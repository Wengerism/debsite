        <p>What is Naturopathy?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Naturopathy is a system of healthcare in which the practitioner works with the patient to improve, maintain or re-establish health.</p>
        <p>Naturopathy focuses on the whole person in order to discover the cause of disease rather than just treating symptoms.</p>

        <p>Deborah is offering both in person consultations from her rooms in Maroubra, as well as phone and telehealth consultations.</p>

        <p>During the consultation, Deborah will take a thorough medical history, as well as dietary and lifestyle assessment. Deborah will bring this information together and work with you to develop a health plan for the next three months.</p>
        <p>Deborah's comprehensive consultation and treatment plan includes nutritional, dietary and lifestyle advice, as well as providing nutritional supplements and herbal medicines where required.</p>

          <p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>How long is an initial consultation?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>An initial Naturopathic or Nutritional consultation will take approximately 1 hour.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>What can I expect from my first appointment?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>During the initial consultation Deborah will develop a stepped health plan that will be implemented over the next three months. Deborah does not always prescribe herbal medicine at your first visit because it may be preferable to initially make dietary and lifestyle changes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>When will I need a follow up appointment?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Deborah will generally arrange a follow up appointment to monitor your progress and reassess your plan. It is not unusual for adjustments to be made to any herbal formula you have been prescribed at the second visit. Follow up appointments are generally 30 minute consultations, although you can specifically request an hour if preferred.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>What assessments are undertaken during a consultation?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="">Physical examinations may include checking your hair, skin, nails, eyes and tongue, as well as taking your blood pressure. Deborah may recommend clinical and laboratory diagnostic tests if deemed necessary or beneficial.  <span>Should you mention something here re adequately obtaining all the information you need via a telehealth consult? i.e. given that you can't obtain hair samples etc is it worth mentioning that the majority of information can be obtained by other means? Or can you examine adequately during the web consult?  Or this can be arranged by some other mens? Or am I overcomplicating?! :-)</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>What are some of the more commonly treated conditions?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="">A person may consult with a Naturopath for almost anything to do with their mental, physical or emotional health. You may simply want a wellness consultation, or something more specific such as high cholesterol, planning for pregnancy, menstrual irregularity, fertility issues (men and women), skin problems, mood disorders or difficulty sleeping. Perhaps you have more acute symptoms that need to be addressed immediately such as urinary tract infections, cold or flu symptoms, allergies, headaches, arthritis or digestive problems. Or there may be a long-standing problem such as an irritable bowel, or autoimmune disease, or you might be looking for additional support during or after treatment for cancer.</p>

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>How much will I have to pay for a consultation?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="">60 minute initial consultations for new clients are $215</p>
          <p>30 minute follow up consultations are $115</p>
          <p>60 minute follow up consultations are $175</p>
