        <p>What is Naturopathy?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Naturopathy is a system of healthcare in which the practitioner works with the patient to improve, maintain or re-establish health.</p>
        <p>Naturopathy focuses on the whole person in order to discover the cause of disease rather than just treating symptoms.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Deborah is offering both in person consultations (when possible by appointment) from her rooms in Maroubra, as well as phone and telehealth online consultations.</p>

        <p>Due to Covid restrictions, all consultations are currently undertaken via telehealth or phone, although this may change in the future.</p>

        
        <p>If you book a telehealth (Coviu) consultation, Deborah will forward a link to your email. At the time of your appointment simply click on the link and follow the prompts. You do not need to download any special programs, and your consultation will be private and secure.</p>

        <p>If you request a phone consultation Deborah will call you at the appointed time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>During the initial consultation Deborah will assess your current health and review your health history. Deborah will work with you to develop an initial 3 month stepped health plan that will incorporate your health goals and address any immediate health concerns you have raised.</p>

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>When will I need a follow up appointment?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Deborah will arrange a follow up appointment approximately 2-6 weeks after your initial consultation depending on your individual needs.

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>What assessments are undertaken during a consultation?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="">Deborah will undertake a comprehensive health, dietary and lifestyle assessment. Any physical assessments undertaken are non-invasive and may include such things as checking your fingernails, hair and tongue diagnosis. Iris diagnosis or iridology assessment will be made when possible. Deborah may recommend clinical and laboratory diagnostic tests such as general and functional pathology or Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) if deemed necessary or beneficial.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>What are some of the more commonly treated conditions?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="">A person may consult with a Naturopath for almost anything to do with their mental, physical or emotional health. You may simply want a wellness consultation or advice on healthy ageing, weight loss, or how to improve energy levels.</p>
          <p class="">It is not uncommon for people to arrange a consultation for something quite specific such as managing high cholesterol, insomnia, planning for pregnancy, menstrual problems, menopause, recurring UTIâ€™s or stress management.</p>
          <p class="">Perhaps you are seeking dietary advice for the management of gout or arthritis, skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, or support for digestive disorders such as reflux, SIBO, and IBS.</p>
          <p class="">Herbal remedies may be requested for more acute symptoms of cold or flu, headaches, sinusitis, or digestive problems such as constipation.</p>
          <p class="">Or you might be looking for additional support or nutritional advice following cancer therapy or other serious illness.</p>
